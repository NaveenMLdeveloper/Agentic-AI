# 🧮 AI-Generated Modern Calculator App with Flowise Agents

This project uses a multi-agent AI workflow built on **Flowise** and powered by **OpenRouter (DeepSeek Chat)** to automatically generate a modern-looking web-based calculator using HTML, inline CSS, and JavaScript.

Each agent in this system contributes to specific parts of the software development process — from UI design to backend logic, testing, and documentation — working together in an orchestrated Flowise environment.

## 🌟 Highlights

- 🔧 **Multi-Agent Collaboration**  
  Agents like Supervisor, Developer, Tester, and Document Writer interact in a well-defined flow.

- 🎨 **Modern Design Output**  
  Calculator UI is clean, minimal, and responsive — generated entirely via LLM prompts.

- 💬 **Prompt-Driven Development**  
  Each stage is guided by carefully designed system prompts to ensure quality, clarity, and modularity.

- ⚙️ **Powered by OpenRouter**  
  Uses the `deepseek-chat-v3-0324` model for intelligence and conversation between agents.
